# FOMOSv2-CLtest

This is just a test for FOMOS trying to make it a real OS

If this doesn't go well it will probably end up like FOMOSv1 except it's a terminal.

# Setup
```shell script
sh setup.sh
```

That will install all requirements then compile and run FOMOS

#
# For developers

After you're done working on FOMOSv2 run:

```shell script
sh deleteCompiledFiles.sh
```
